A webpage that talks about designing fictional aircraft in a realistic manner. 
would include diagrams and labels. top-bar with page title, searchbar, hamburger menu,
and other menus. The idea is it is a sort of guide for how to design your own fictional
aircraft and have them be believable. There would be a basic, intermediate, and advanced
guides that would cover different levels of realism. There might also be a section to cover
modelling such an aircraft in a 3d modelling application. But the majority would be how to draw
out a design on paper. There will also have to be a link to a page for all the terminology 
thats used in aviation (things like: slats, spoilers, trim tabs, canopy, aelerons, etc...)
