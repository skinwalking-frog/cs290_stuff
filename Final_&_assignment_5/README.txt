files are still named assignment_4 because I didn't want to update references in each file.
Ignore the file server.py it was just a test.
For the server side scripting requirements, simple_server.py is the appropriate file.

re-review of websites from assignment_0:

Netflix - https://www.netflix.com/browse
like - honestly a very well designed website, everything you need is in front of you, easy to read, easy to understand, easy to navigate, looks good.
dislike - the few things that still bother me are that the previews automatically play, and volume is on by default, theres also only one theme. 

Artstation - https://www.artstation.com/?sort_by=community&dimension=3d
like - for its purpose I suppose it works, the main thing you'd come here for is the majority of the page and is instantly infront of you.
dislike - too many widgets/buttons on screen in different locations, doesnt always work properly on mobile, filtering categories is a little weird, sign in with google fails half the time.

Blender - https://www.blender.org/
like - simple layout yet visually apealing. Images and font are big and not crammed in, easy to read/follow, everything you need is on the topbar. 
dislike - top bar disappears only when scrolling down, however you would only ever scroll down if you didnt need anything on the topbar.

Newegg - https://www.newegg.com/
like - has a darkmode toggle, most things your looking for are on the the top of page, and if its not its on the botto. 
dislike - trying to cram too much on screen. so many categories it doesnt fit on screen so it rotates through them making buttons hard to find. Hover popups.

Adobe - https://www.adobe.com/
like - Super simple homepage, no information overload or confusion on what things do, actually very well put together website.
dislike - not really much to dislike other than the fact that it's Adobe...

review of earlier projects: 

-assignment_1: not a bad start of a template for a blog, scolls down the page. Could definitely use much more of the screen space horizontally.
-assignment_2: color theme is too bold, sidebar could be toggleable instead of fixed, funny content though.
-assignment_3: basically just a template with not much in it, not sure what to judge here.
-assignment_4: I'm actually really proud of this one, it looks nice, easy to follow, does what it needs. Just wish the buttons for dropdowns were toggle and hoverable.
-assignment_5: im using this final as assignment_5 also because I ran out of time.
